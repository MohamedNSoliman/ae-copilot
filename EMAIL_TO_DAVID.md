**Subject:** MoZilla GTM Account Brief Generator - Interview Project

Hi David,

I wanted to share **MoZilla**, a GTM Account Brief Generator I built as part of the interview process. MoZilla helps Account Executives quickly generate comprehensive account briefs for outbound outreach through a conversational, ChatGPT-like interface.

**Key features:**
- Conversational UI for generating account briefs (company, persona, competitors)
- User authentication with saved briefs functionality
- Web research integration (DuckDuckGo) for company intelligence
- Optional LLM integration (OpenAI/Anthropic) for personalized content
- Modern, Cursor-inspired dark theme UI
- Built entirely with Cursor

**The app is ready to run on GitHub:**
https://github.com/MohamedNSoliman/account-brief-generator

**Quick setup (3 steps):**
1. Clone the repo
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python3 -m streamlit run app.py`

Detailed setup instructions are in SETUP.md. The app includes user accounts, saved briefs, and both CLI and web interfaces.

Happy to answer any questions or walk through the codebase.

Best,
Mohamed
